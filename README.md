# Marveless-Frontend
Marveless is a interactive website that allows a user to learn more about their favorite Marvel characters and comics or perhaps discover new favorite.
## Motivation
As a life long fan of the Marvel Comics and more recently a fan of the Marvel Cinemtic Universe, when I learned that a Marvel API existed I jumped at the opportunity to build something that could demostrate my love for the Marvel brand as well as be an app that others could use to learn more about the Marvel universe.
## Build Status

React and React Hooks, Ruby on Rails, CSS, Marvel API

- Users can view view information on one comic at random
